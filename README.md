Hello everybody my name is Mohammed Alessa. I'm a computer science trainer in technical college at Taif, Saudi Arabia.
I'm a lone wolf who loves to work with computers and machines only.
This repository is dedicated to programming that serves the Arabic language.
I'm willing to share and contribute in same projects.
I have been programming since 2004, but I'm still learning. 
I'm not free because I have a full time day job to teach computer to college students. 
You can reach me at dhadgroup@gmail.com and my website that font end this repository is Dhadgroup.com
